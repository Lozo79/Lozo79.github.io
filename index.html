      <h2>The Philippines</h2>
      <div class="main"></div>
      <article class="post">
      <blockquote>
      <p>The Philippines, home to over 7,000 islands is truly a wonderland. It is a tropical paradise rich in history and beauty and with a population that is welcoming and kind. One can visit the islands to get lost in its splendor while also finding oneself while admiring its beauty.  </p>
  </p>
  
  <p>Manila, once known as the “Jewel of the Orient” during the Spanish Colonial era is the capital and its largest city. The metro area is home to over 22 Million people and is the gateway to the Philippines. You can easily catch flights to other parts of the Philippines as well as Asia from Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Although Luzon, the island Manila is on is worth exploring, I prefer to travel south to the central region of the Philippines where you can visit the island of Panay where every January a festival called Ati Atihan, celebrates the Indigenous people of the Philippines and has been called the Carnival of the Philippines. Panay is also home to Boracay. Once voted as the #1 island in the world it is now a regular tourist destination and is known for its white sand beaches and party atmosphere. From Panay, it is a short flight to 2 other Central Philippines islands, Cebu and Bohol. Cebu is where you can swim with whale sharks and go canyoneering at Kawasan Falls. In Bohol, you can gaze upon the Chocolate Hills and visit a conservatory that is home to one of the world’s smallest primate, the Tarsier. Further west from the Visayas (the group of Central Philippines islands) is Palawan. Palawan is still considered a hidden gem but is quickly gaining in popularity. The region’s capital, Puerta Princessa is home to one of the longest subterranean rivers in the world. It is also where you can take a shuttle to arguably one of the most beautiful and rustic areas in the Philippines, El Nido. El Nido is about a 5 hour drive from Puerta Princessa and is a sight to behold. There are numerous small islands to visit and beaches to call your own. But, if you truly want to escape it all, visit Coron. It’s a long boat ride from El Nido but you can also fly into its small regional airport. Coron is rustic and somewhat untouched. The water is as blue and clear and anywhere in the world and is where you can truly escape from it all.</p>
